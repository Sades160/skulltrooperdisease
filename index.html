        <h2>The Spooky Season Plague</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">Skulltrooper Disease</span> was a highly contagious plague that swept across Fortnite Island during <strong>The Spooky Season</strong> in <strong>Season X </strong>. Believed to have originated from a cursed Skulltrooper outfit discovered in Haunted Hills, the disease spread rapidly through emotes, sprays, and proximity.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms and Impact</h2>
        <p>Infected players transformed into glowing skeletal versions of themselves, compulsively performed emotes mid-battle, and hoarded loot without using it. The disease decimated the population, leaving only a few <span class="highlight">Bush Campers</span> untouched.</p>

        <h2>Failed Containment Efforts</h2>
        <p>Efforts to contain the outbreak, including Bandage Bazookas and Chug Splashes, proved futile as infected players weaponized these items for coordinated dance parties. The only known cure was a <strong>Victory Royale</strong>, though this was nearly impossible due to the aggressive tactics of infected squads.</p>

        <h2>The Resolution</h2>
        <p>Epic Games eventually ended the outbreak through a 12.31 Hotfix, introducing "<span class="highlight">Cure Balloons</span>" and nerfing the Skulltrooper glow. Despite its resolution, Skulltrooper Disease left a lasting impact on Fortnite culture.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Skulltrooper Disease is now celebrated annually during <strong>Fortnitemares</strong> with spooky skins, emotes like the "<span class="highlight">Plague Shuffle</span>," and the infamous "<span class="highlight">OG Spooky Sneeze</span>" back bling. While some players claim it was a marketing stunt to boost Skulltrooper skin sales, Epic Games maintains that it was simply a "<span class="highlight">glitch in the simulation</span>."</p>
